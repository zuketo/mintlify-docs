## Writing guidelines

- **Use active voice**: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- **Address the reader directly**: Use "you" instead of "the user"
- **Keep sentences concise**: Aim for one idea per sentence
- **Lead with the goal**: Start instructions with what the user wants to accomplish
- **Use consistent terminology**: Don't alternate between synonyms for the same concept
- **Include examples**: Show, don't just tell
